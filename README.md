# Mario-puzzle
A fun puzzle game with Mario from Super Mario Bros.
In order to play the game, do the following:
1) Download WAMP (for Windows machines), LAMP (for Linux machines), MAMP (for Macintosh machines)
2) Save all the files from here (my github repository Mario-puzzle) in one folder and name it anything you want (for example, "puzzle")
3) Put that "puzzle" folder in the "htdocs" or "www" directory when you open your WAMP, LAMP, MAMP folder
4) Run WAMP/LAMP/MAMP (if the icon is green everything works fine)
5) Open a web browser and type "localhost:8888/puzzle" and select the HW7.html file to see the puzzle game
6) 8888 is the port number but for your machine it might be different - it could be 80 or 8080
7) If you wish you can put in any image you would like to solve the puzzle but it has to be 400x400 pixels.
7) Enjoy the game!
